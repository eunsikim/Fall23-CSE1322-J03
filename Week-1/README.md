# Variables, Assignment, Data Types, and I/O

## Primitive Data Types

- We call the following Data Types primitive because they are simple data that can represent a single basic values.
- These Data Types have fixed sizes which determine their range, these are the following
    
    
    | Data type | Range | Size |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | byte | -128 to 127 | 1 byte |
    | short | -32,768 to 32,767 | 2 bytes |
    | int | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 | 4 bytes |
    | long | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 | 8 bytes |
    | float | ~3.4 x 10^38 to 3.4 x 10^38 (~6-7 decimal digits) | 4 bytes |
    | double | ~1.7 x 10^308 to 1.7 x 10^308 (~15 decimal digits) | 8 bytes |
    | char | Unicode characters (0 to 65,535 or '\u0000' to '\uffff') | 2 bytes |
    | boolean | true or false values | 1 bit |

## Complex Data Types

- Complex Data Types are objects. They can hold multiple primitive values, functions, and more complex data types.
- One common example of a Complex Data Types are the `String` class and `Scanner` class.

## Variables

- To initialize a variable in Java, you must specify its Data Type and its Identifier. A variableâ€™s initial value is optional.
- To initialize a variable with an initial value you must use the assignment symbol `=`. Furthermore, in cases of Complex Data Types you must also use the `new` keyword to construct the object.
    
    ```java
    Dog d1 = new Dog("Rover");
    ```
    

## I/O operations

- In java, print statements use the `System.out.println()` or `System.out.prin()` functions to print or display text and values into the console.
    
    ```java
    System.out.print("This prints a string, but does not leave a new line after it has been printed. ");
    System.out.println("While this print statement will leave a new line after it has been printed");
    System.out.print("See?");
    ```
    
- To take an input from the console, we need to create a scanner object.
- To make use of the Scanner object, we must import the proper library `import java.util.Scanner;`
    
    ```java
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); //System.in is used to take in the keyboard input from the console
    ```
    
- Furthermore, to use the `Scanner` object to take an input and store it into a variable we must use some of the functions from the `Scanner` class.
    
    Here are some useful ones:
    
    | short | sc.nextShort() |
    | --- | --- |
    | int | sc.nextInt() |
    | long | sc.nextLong() |
    | float | sc.nextFloat() |
    | double | sc.nextDouble() |
    | boolean | sc.nextBoolean() |
    | char | sc.next.chatAt(0) |
    | String | sc.nextLine() |
    
    ```java
    int x;
    x = sc.nextInt();
    ```
    

# Selection Structures

- If/else if/else statements
    
    ```java
    if(x > 10){
    	...
    }
    else if(x > 5){
    	...
    }
    else{
    	...
    }
    ```
    
- Switch case statements
    
    ```java
    switch(x){
    	case 1:
    		...
    		break;
    
    	case 2:
    		...
    		break;
    
    	default:
    		...
    }
    ```
    

# Repetition Structures

- For loop
    
    ```java
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    	...
    }
    ```
    
- While loop
    
    ```java
    while(i < 10){
    	...
    	i++;
    }
    ```
    
- Do-While loop
    
    ```java
    do{
    	...
    	i++;
    } while(i < 10);
    ```
    

# Arrays

- Most likely, arrays are the first data structure you have been introduced to.
- Arrays allows you to store data (either primitive or complex) organized under indexes within the same identifier.
- In Java, we start counting the indexes from 0.
- Arrays are a good way to organize data, since it allows you to use repetition structures to traverse it.
- Otherwise, arrays are limited. One of these limitations being that arrays are fixed size. This means that an array cannot change size in runtime.
- Here are some examples of 1D and 2D arrays:
    
    ```java
    int[] array = new int[2];
    
    // Insertion
    array[0] = 1;
    array[1] = 2;
    array[2] = 3;
    
    // Print
    for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    	System.out.println(aray[i]);
    }
    
    ```
    
    ```java
    Dog[][] arrayOfDogs = new Dog[1][1];
    
    // Assuming you fill the 2D array with Dog objects.
    
    // Print
    for(int i = 0; i < arrayOfDogs.length; i++){
    	for(int j = 0; j < arrayOfDogs[0].length; j++){
    		System.out.println(arrayOfDogs[i][j].getName());
    	}
    }
    ```
    

# Methods

- Methods are a block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks.
- Methods helps us encapsulating some of the functionalities of our code, promote reusable code, and it makes our code be more organized.
    
    ```java
    /**
     * Calculates and returns the area of a rectangle.
     *
     * This method takes the length and width of a rectangle as parameters
     * and calculates the area by multiplying the length and width values.
     * The result represents the total area of the rectangle.
     *
     * @param length The length of the rectangle.
     * @param width The width of the rectangle.
     * @return The calculated area of the rectangle.
     */
    
    public static int getArea(int length, int width){
    	return length * width;
    }
    ```
    
    ```java
    /**
     * Prints the names of dogs in a 2D array of Dog objects.
     *
     * This method takes a 2D array of Dog objects as input and iterates through
     * the array to print the names of the dogs. It uses nested loops to traverse
     * rows and columns of the array and accesses each Dog object to retrieve
     * its name using the `getName()` method.
     *
     * @param array A 2D array containing Dog objects.
     */
    
    public static void printDogArray(Dog[][] array){
    	for(int i = 0; i < arrayOfDogs.length; i++){
    		for(int j = 0; j < arrayOfDogs[0].length; j++){
    			System.out.println(arrayOfDogs[i][j].getName());
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```
    

# Classes and Objects

- Classes and Objects are the fundamental concepts for Object Oriented Programming.
- You can think of Classes as a blueprint or template to create objects from.
- While objects are the instances created based on a class.
    
    ```java
    class Car {
    	private String brand;
    	private String model;
    	
    	// Constructor
    	Car(String brand, String model) {
    	  this.brand = brand;
    	  this.model = model;
    	}
    	
    	void startEngine() {
    	  System.out.println("Engine started!");
    	}
    	
    	void stopEngine() {
    		System.out.println("Engine stopped.");
    	}
    	
    	// Getter for brand
    	public String getBrand() {
    	  return brand;
    	}
    	
    	// Setter for brand
    	public void setBrand(String carBrand) {
    	  brand = carBrand;
    	}
    	
    	// Getter for model
    	public String getModel() {
    	  return model;
    	}
    	
    	// Setter for model
    	public void setModel(String carModel) {
    	  model = carModel;
    	}
    }
    ```
    
    ```java
    public class ExampleA{
    	public static void main(String[] args){
    		Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry");
    		myCar.startEngine();
    
    		System.out.println(myCar.getBrand());
    
    		myCar.setBrand("Honda");
    		System.out.println(myCar.getBrand());
    	}
    }
    ```
